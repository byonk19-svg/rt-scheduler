# Design System — Teamwise (RT Scheduler)

## Product Context

- **What this is:** A web application for respiratory therapy scheduling — six-week coverage cycles, availability intake, publish workflows, and role-aware dashboards for managers and clinical staff.
- **Who it's for:** Hospital and department managers (planning, publish, roster edits) and therapists/leads (availability, schedule visibility, operational status).
- **Space/industry:** Healthcare operations / workforce scheduling SaaS — users expect trust, legibility under stress, and fast scanning of dense calendars.
- **Project type:** Web app / operational dashboard (Next.js App Router) with a smaller marketing/auth shell on public routes.

## Aesthetic Direction

- **Direction:** Industrial/utilitarian with calm warmth — “control room” clarity on schedule surfaces, softened by a paper-like canvas so the product feels human, not sterile ERP.
- **Decoration level:** Intentional but minimal — avoid heavy gradients, illustration clutter, or decorative noise behind data grids.
- **Mood:** Confident, calm, and direct. Managers should feel in control; staff should read status at a glance.
- **Reference research:** Healthcare scheduling UX emphasizes accessibility, reduced cognitive load, semantic status color, and mobile-friendly density (see industry write-ups on healthcare dashboards and nurse scheduling UX — patterns inform this doc; no single competitor is copied).

## Typography

- **Display/Hero (marketing + rare page titles):** Instrument Serif — editorial old-style serif loaded at weight 400 only; used on the landing hero h1, auth left panel headline, and any future display moments. CSS class: `font-display`.
- **Body/UI:** Plus Jakarta Sans — clean modern geometric sans; primary interface type for all app surfaces. Replaces DM Sans. Integrated via `globals.css` / Next font pipeline with CSS var `--font-plus-jakarta-sans`.
- **UI/Labels:** Same family as body; use weight (500–700) and letter-spacing for hierarchy instead of a third sans.
- **Data/Tables:** Plus Jakarta Sans with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on counts, times, and schedule columns so digits align in coverage views.
- **Code:** Geist Mono (or system monospace stack) for technical surfaces, IDs, and developer-facing diagnostics.
- **Loading:** Google Fonts via `next/font` — Instrument Serif (display, weight 400 normal+italic) in `(public)/layout.tsx`; Plus Jakarta Sans (all weights) in root `layout.tsx`.
- **Scale (initial targets):**
  - `text-xs` 0.75rem / labels, meta
  - `text-sm` 0.875rem / dense table cells
  - `text-base` 1rem / default body
  - `text-lg`–`text-xl` section headers
  - `text-2xl`+ reserved for page titles and marketing hero

## Color

- **Approach:** Restrained — one dominant primary for actions and wayfinding, neutrals for surfaces, semantic colors reserved for meaning.
- **Primary:** `#1e5c64` (HSL reference `187 55% 28%`) — trust / clinical calm; all primary buttons, key links, focus rings.
- **Attention / brand accent:** `#e9a43a` (HSL reference `38 90% 55%`) — avatar, logo mark, subtle highlights; **not** a second competing CTA color on forms.
- **Neutrals:** Warm paper field (`~hsl(38 18% 96%)` background), off-white cards, cool-warm slate text (`~hsl(220 25% 12%)` foreground), muted lines at `~hsl(32 14% 86%)`.
- **Semantic:**
  - Success: green family for “live / healthy / complete” states
  - Warning: amber family for drafts, deadlines, “needs attention”
  - Error: red family for blockers and validation failures
  - Info: blue family for neutral informational callouts  
    Map to existing CSS variables (`--success-*`, `--warning-*`, etc.) and keep pairs legible in WCAG-ish terms.
- **Dark mode:** Reduce saturation ~10–20% on large fields; lift contrast on sidebar text; keep primary legible on dark surfaces (lighter teal is acceptable).

## Spacing

- **Base unit:** 8px (Tailwind default); prefer multiples of 4 only for fine alignment inside components.
- **Density:** Comfortable default for manager surfaces; consider a future “compact” calendar mode rather than shrinking global padding everywhere.
- **Scale:** `2xs` 4 · `xs` 8 · `sm` 12–16 · `md` 16–24 · `lg` 24–32 · `xl` 32–40 · `2xl` 48 · `3xl` 64 (map to Tailwind tokens in implementation).

## Layout

- **Approach:** Hybrid — strict grid alignment and predictable chrome inside the app; marketing may use slightly more expressive vertical rhythm while still sharing tokens.
- **Grid:** 12-column mental model at `lg+`; collapse to single column on mobile with bottom nav or drawer patterns as already established in the app shell.
- **Max content width:** Marketing `min(1120px, 100% - 2rem)`; tool pages often full-width with internal max width on prose blocks only.
- **Border radius:** Hierarchical — small controls 6–8px, cards 10–14px, pills 9999px; avoid one global “bubble radius” on every surface.

## Motion

- **Approach:** Minimal-functional — motion explains state change; no ornamental loops on data-heavy pages.
- **Easing:** Enter `ease-out`, exit `ease-in`, spatial moves `ease-in-out`.
- **Duration:** micro 50–100ms (hover), short 150–220ms (dialogs), medium 250–360ms (page transitions if any).

## Shadow map (elevation utilities)

All elevation uses **named classes** in `src/app/globals.css` (search for `Elevation shadows`). They compose `box-shadow` from **`color-mix(in srgb, var(--foreground) …)`** or **`var(--primary)`** / **`var(--attention)`** / **`var(--destructive)`** / **`var(--warning-border)`** — not hardcoded slate RGB.

**Rules for new UI**

- Prefer an existing **`shadow-tw-*`** class before adding a new one.
- If nothing fits, add a **new utility** next to the others in `globals.css` and document it in the table below — do not use ad-hoc `shadow-[0_…rgba(…)]` in JSX.
- **Print:** on the availability print surface, `shadow-tw-md` and `shadow-tw-md-strong` are stripped (see `@media print` in `globals.css`).

## Implementation Alignment

- **Source of truth during migration:** `DESIGN.md` states intent; `src/app/globals.css` holds shipped tokens. When they diverge, update CSS in small, testable steps and keep CLAUDE.md constraints (no random hex literals in JSX — use tokens).
- **Anti-slop (explicit):** No purple gradient hero, no three-column “feature + icon circle” filler, no Inter-as-default without a deliberate reason.

### Shipped wiring (2026-04-11)

- **`src/app/layout.tsx`:** `DM_Sans` with CSS variable `--font-dm-sans` (body + UI); `Fraunces` with `--font-display` (loaded on `<html>`). Plus Jakarta removed per typography spec.
- **`src/app/globals.css`:** `--font-sans` resolves to DM Sans; `.font-heading` / `.app-page-title` use sans only; `.font-display` uses `var(--font-display)` for serif display.
- **Marketing / auth:** Homepage hero (`src/app/page.tsx`) and login/signup brand column use `.font-display` for the large line only; forms and page titles stay sans.
- **Data density:** Inbox metric card values use `tabular-nums` (`ManagerTriageDashboard`); extend the same class anywhere counts and dates should align in columns.
- **2026-04-11 (pass 2):** `tabular-nums` on `StatsCard` and shift-board `KpiTile` values; `Geist_Mono` loaded in `layout.tsx` with `--font-geist-mono` (see `@theme` `--font-mono`); decorative backgrounds in `globals.css` (`.teamwise-grid-bg*`, `.teamwise-aurora-bg`, table row hover, new `.teamwise-hero-grid-bg`) use `color-mix` with `var(--primary)` / `var(--muted)` instead of hardcoded RGB; homepage hero grid uses `.teamwise-hero-grid-bg`; `StatsCard` shadow uses `color-mix` with `var(--foreground)`.
- **2026-04-11 (pass 3 — elevation):** Legacy arbitrary slate shadows removed; canonical list and usage guidance is **Shadow map** above (source: `globals.css` → `Elevation shadows`).
- **2026-04-12 (homepage — luminous shell):** Public `/` originally added `--home-glow-warm`, `--home-glow-cool`, `--home-panel`, `--home-panel-border`, `--home-shadow` plus `.teamwise-home-luminous`, `.teamwise-home-grid`, `.teamwise-home-preview-shell`, `.teamwise-home-preview-sheen` utilities. **Removed 2026-04-27** when the homepage was redesigned to the dark-teal hero — these utilities are no longer present in `globals.css`.

### Shipped wiring (2026-04-25)

- **Typography reversal:** `DM_Sans` + `Fraunces` swapped back to **Plus Jakarta Sans** (body/UI, `--font-plus-jakarta-sans`) + **Instrument Serif** (display, `--font-display`). Reflects the updated typography section above; replaces the 2026-04-11 wiring entry.

### Shipped wiring (2026-04-27)

- **Public surface trim:** Homepage feature strip removed (no longer markets to a public audience — this is an internal RT-dept tool); auth-page brand panels stop duplicating the homepage hero copy. `/login` left panel says "Welcome back."; `/signup` left panel says "New here?" + the manager-approval explanation.
- **New tokens in `:root`:** `--marketing-hero-bg: var(--primary)` (single alias used by `/`, `/login`, `/signup` brand panels) and `--scrim: color-mix(in srgb, var(--foreground) 50%, transparent)` (used by `<DialogOverlay>` instead of `bg-black/50`).
- **Dark-mode brand color fix:** `--primary` (and `--ring`, `--highlight`, `--chart-1`) in `.dark` moved from `hsl(203 93% 35%)` (blue) → `hsl(187 60% 50%)` (lifted teal). Brand identity now stays in the 187° hue family across light/dark; `--primary-foreground` flipped to dark text in dark mode for AA contrast on the lighter teal.
- **Dead CSS removed:** `--home-glow-warm`, `--home-glow-cool`, `--home-panel`, `--home-panel-border`, `--home-shadow` tokens and `.teamwise-home-luminous`, `.teamwise-home-grid`, `.teamwise-home-preview-shell`, `.teamwise-home-preview-sheen` utilities deleted from `globals.css` (unused outside tests).
- **On-dark contrast pass:** All ad-hoc `text-white/22..50` opacity values on the dark teal hero/auth panels raised to `/70` (eyebrow / large-tracked) or `/85` (body) so on-dark text passes WCAG AA on `--primary`. Outline-button border bumped from `/22` to `/40`.

| 2026-04-27 | Dark-mode primary stays in teal hue family                 | Brand should not flip hues across light/dark; previous `hsl(203 …)` blue was a different color, not a darker teal                          |
